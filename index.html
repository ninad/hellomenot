<h2>👋 Hello, Hi, Yo! – You there?</h2>

<p>You're probably here because you said something like "Hello," "Hi," or "Are you there?" to someone over chat 🙂</p>

<p>Saying any of these and waiting is not an ideal way to start conversations over a team chat app at work. Instead, it's better to start by providing context about what you want to discuss.</p>

<h3>How to start conversations better:</h3>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Instead of saying:</th>
            <th>Say something like:</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>⛔️ Hello!</td>
            <td>✅ Hey, I want to talk about __. Is this a good time?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>⛔️ Hey, do you have a min?</td>
            <td>✅ Hi, I’m working on __ and was wondering if you can help me with __</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>⛔️ Are you there?</td>
            <td>✅ Hi, when can we meet for __?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>⛔️ Hey, quick question!</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>⛔️ Hello, I need help</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Why do people leave it at "Hello"?</h3>

<p>Conversations are the most natural way of communicating. When talking to someone in person, we typically wait until we have their full attention—like a nod, a sound, or eye contact—before speaking further. Because chatting on tools like Flock or Slack feels similar to talking in person, our brains naturally expect this kind of acknowledgment before continuing.</p>

<h3>Why is it a bad idea?</h3>

<p>Unlike face-to-face conversations, chatting or texting doesn't require immediate attention. People often multitask, so clearly stating your need upfront saves everyone time.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>⛔️ Conversation A (Inefficient)</th>
            <th>✅ Conversation B (Efficient)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Ram:</strong> Hey Shyam!<br><em>⌛️ Shyam waits for Ram to continue...<br>⌛️ Shyam realizes Ram expects a reply...<br><strong>Shyam:</strong> Hey Ram…<br><strong>Ram:</strong> Do you have Sita’s email address?<br><strong>Shyam:</strong> Yes, it’s sita@geeta.in</em></td>
            <td><strong>Ram:</strong> Hey Shyam, can you please share Sita’s email?<br><strong>Shyam:</strong> It's sita@geeta.in</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
