# 👋 Hello, Hi, Yo! – You there?

## You're probably here because you said something like "Hello," "Hi," or "Are you there?" to someone over chat 🙂

Saying any of these and waiting is not an ideal way to start conversations over a team chat app at work. Instead, it's better to start by providing context about what you want to discuss.

## How to start conversations better:

| Instead of saying:          | Say something like:                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⛔️ Hello!                   | ✅ Hey, I want to talk about __. Is this a good time?                  |
| ⛔️ Hey, do you have a min?  | ✅ Hi, I’m working on __ and was wondering if you can help me with __   |
| ⛔️ Are you there?           | ✅ Hi, when can we meet for __?                                        |
| ⛔️ Hey, quick question!     |                                                                        |
| ⛔️ Hello, I need help       |                                                                        |

## Why do people leave it at "Hello"?

Conversations are the most natural way of communicating. When talking to someone in person, we typically wait until we have their full attention—like a nod, a sound, or eye contact—before speaking further. Because chatting on tools like Flock or Slack feels similar to talking in person, our brains naturally expect this kind of acknowledgment before continuing.

## Why is it a bad idea?

Unlike face-to-face conversations, chatting or texting doesn't require immediate attention. People often multitask, so clearly stating your need upfront saves everyone time.
